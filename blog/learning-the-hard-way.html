        Learning things the hard way — and why clarity matters
      </h1>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

        <p>
          I’ve spent a lot of time figuring things out the hard way. In business,
          in finance, and in the systems I tried to build, clarity rarely came
          early.
        </p>

        <p>
          There was confusion around what mattered, what didn’t, and where my
          actual strengths were. That uncertainty wasn’t comfortable — but it
          forced me to slow down and think deeply.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, I realized that most people and businesses aren’t failing
          because they lack effort. They’re struggling because things aren’t
          clear enough to make confident decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, my work is shaped by that experience. I focus on reducing
          unnecessary complexity — designing systems, products, and strategies
          that help people move forward with confidence instead of hesitation.
