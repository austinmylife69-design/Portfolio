        <p class="fade-up">
          I learned most things by necessity, not by plan.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          When I first became interested in business, I did not have access to mentors,
          courses, or formal training. Living in Zambia, that is not unusual. If you want
          to learn something, you often have to piece it together yourself. So I taught
          myself. I read textbooks meant for classrooms I was not in. I watched long videos,
          paused them, replayed parts I did not understand, and tried to apply the ideas on
          my own.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          At the time, it felt inefficient. Looking back, it was the only option I had.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          I learned design the same way. Not because I wanted to become a designer, but
          because I could not afford one. I needed logos, layouts, and visuals, and hiring
          someone simply was not realistic. So I opened design software and started
          experimenting. The first results were bad. Spacing was off. Colors clashed.
          Nothing felt consistent.
        </p>

       <p class="fade-up">
          Slowly, patterns started to emerge. What worked. What didn’t. The work improved,
          but only after a lot of trial and error.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          Building websites followed a similar path. Drag-and-drop builders were expensive.
          WordPress felt heavy and overly technical for what I needed at the time. I wanted
          control without the overhead, so I started figuring things out on my own. I broke
          things. I rebuilt them. I copied patterns, adjusted them, and learned just enough
          to move forward.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          If you are building things in Zambia, you learn quickly that you cannot always
          throw money at problems. You improvise, adapt, and keep moving. That mindset
          shaped how I learned.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          More recently, I started using AI to help me code. Not because I was looking for
          shortcuts, but because it made building possible without full development teams
          or complex tools. Even then, it was not smooth. Things worked halfway. Then
          stopped. Then worked again. Progress came with frustration attached.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          None of this was clean or linear.
        </p>

       <p class="fade-up">
          For a long time, I thought the struggle meant I was doing something wrong. That I
          was behind. That if I were smarter or more prepared, things would feel easier. I
          was busy most of the time, but I was not always sure I was moving in the right
          direction.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          Eventually, I started noticing a pattern.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          Whenever things felt stuck, it was rarely because I lacked effort. It was usually
          because I lacked clarity. There were too many ideas competing at once. Too many
          things felt urgent. Without a clear priority, every decision felt heavier than it
          needed to be.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          Once I saw that, it explained a lot.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          Clarity did not come from learning more tools. It came from slowing down. From
          asking simpler questions before starting again. What is this for. What problem
          am I actually solving. What can wait.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          When those questions were clear, progress felt lighter. Not faster, but steadier.
          I started fewer things and finished more of them.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-up">
          Today, clarity shapes how I work more than ambition or speed. I still learn
          things the hard way at times. That part has not disappeared. But I am quicker to
          recognize when confusion is the real problem. Before adding complexity, I try
          to remove noise. Before building more, I try to understand better.
        </p>

       <p class="fade-up">
          Most of what I know came from not having options. Building in Zambia forces that
          kind of learning. You either figure things out or you stay stuck. I paid for that
          education with time and mistakes. What it gave me was a way of thinking that
          values clarity, especially when resources are limited.
